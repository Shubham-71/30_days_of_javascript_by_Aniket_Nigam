/* Javascript contain many data types that holds different values.
There are two types of data types in Javascript

1. Primitive Data type
2. Non Primitive Data type

In js you don't need to specify type of variable because it is a dynamically used by js engine. you need to use var here to specify the data types. It can contain any type of value like number, strings , etc.

For example
var a = 40;
var b = "Hello everyone this is the 30 day of js course"


Primitive Data Type : It includes strings, Numbers, boolean, Undefined, null

Non Primitive  Data Types: It include Object, Array, RegExp(represent regular expression)
